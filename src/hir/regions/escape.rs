//! Solver-side projection of escape's frontier verdict onto regions.
//!
//! Escape ([`crate::hir::EscapeInfo`]) is the authority for *whether* a value
//! escapes; it answers in its own vocabulary — bindings and `HirId`s — and never
//! sees a region. This module maps that verdict into the region domain using the
//! solver's own `alloc_region` / `binding_source_regions` maps, the coordinate
//! transform the region consumers (the ownership Shared-seed `compute_shared_seeds`,
//! the merge gate's not-returned check, branch compensation's exclusion) need. It is
//! the **only** place escape facts meet regions — escape holds no region plumbing,
//! the solver holds no escape logic.
//!
//! Projection rule: a frontier **binding** projects through `binding_source_regions`
//! (the regions its value may point into); a frontier **allocation site** (a returned
//! lambda, an atomless aggregate, a call result, an emitted/sent literal) projects
//! through `alloc_region`. A frontier `HirId` that names no allocation (an immediate)
//! is simply absent from `alloc_region` and contributes no region — so escape's
//! deliberate over-approximation (`record_frontier_sites`) costs nothing here.
