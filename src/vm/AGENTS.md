# vm

Bytecode execution. Stack-based operand handling with register-addressed locals.

## Responsibility

Execute bytecode instructions. Manage:
- Operand stack
- Global bindings
- Call frames and stack traces
- Closure environments
- Fiber state and signals

Does NOT:
- Compile code (that's `compiler/`, `hir/`, `lir/`)
- Parse source (that's `reader/`)
- Define primitives (that's `primitives/`)

## Interface

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `VM` | Global state + root Fiber. Per-execution state lives on `vm.fiber` |
| `SignalBits` | Internal return type: `SIG_OK`, `SIG_ERROR`, `SIG_YIELD`, `SIG_DEBUG`, `SIG_RESUME`, `SIG_FFI`, `SIG_PROPAGATE`, `SIG_CANCEL`, `SIG_HALT`, `SIG_IO` |
| `CallFrame` | Function name, IP, frame base |

## Signal-based returns

Internal VM methods return `SignalBits` (or `(SignalBits, usize)` for the
inner dispatch loop):
- `SIG_OK` (0): Normal completion. Value in `fiber.signal`.
- `SIG_ERROR` (1): Error. Error array in `fiber.signal` as `[:keyword "message"]`.
- `SIG_YIELD` (2): Fiber yield. Value in `fiber.signal`, suspended frames in `fiber.suspended`.
- `SIG_RESUME` (8): VM-internal. Fiber primitive requests VM-side execution.
- `SIG_PROPAGATE` (32): VM-internal. `fiber/propagate` re-signals caught signal.
- `SIG_CANCEL` (64): VM-internal. `fiber/cancel` injects error into fiber.
- `SIG_QUERY` (128): VM-internal. Primitive reads VM state (call counts, global bindings, arena stats/count/scope-stats/fiber-stats). `arena/allocs` is intercepted before dispatch (re-entrant).
- `SIG_HALT` (256): Graceful VM termination. Value in `fiber.signal`. Non-resumable; fiber is Dead.

The public `execute_bytecode` method is the translation boundary — it converts
`SignalBits` to `Result<Value, String>` for external callers. On `SIG_ERROR`,
it extracts the error struct from `fiber.signal` and formats the error message.

Instruction handlers no longer return `Result<(), String>`. VM bugs panic
immediately. User errors set `fiber.signal` to `(SIG_ERROR, error_val(kind, msg))`
and push `Value::NIL` to keep the stack consistent.

## Rc threading

Bytecode and constants are threaded through the dispatch loop as `&Rc<Vec<u8>>`
and `&Rc<Vec<Value>>`. Individual instruction handlers dereference to slices
(`&[u8]`, `&[Value]`). Only the dispatch loop and its direct callees
(`handle_yield`, `handle_call`) need the `Rc` — they clone it cheaply when
creating `SuspendedFrame`s or `TailCallInfo`.

- `execute_bytecode` wraps raw slices in `Rc` once at the public boundary
- `execute_bytecode_from_ip` / `execute_bytecode_saving_stack` take `&Rc`
- `TailCallInfo` is `(Rc<Vec<u8>>, Rc<Vec<Value>>, Rc<Vec<Value>>)` — tail
  calls clone the Rc (cheap), not the Vec (expensive)
- `closure_env` parameter is `&Rc<Vec<Value>>` (non-optional; empty Rc for no env)
- `execute_closure_bytecode` takes `&Rc` params directly (no `.to_vec()` copy);
  used by JIT trampolines where the closure already owns Rc'd data

## Primitive dispatch (NativeFn)

All primitives are `NativeFn`: `fn(&[Value]) -> (SignalBits, Value)`. The VM
dispatches the return signal in `handle_primitive_signal()` (`signal.rs`):
- `SIG_OK` → push value to stack
- `SIG_ERROR` → store `(SIG_ERROR, value)` in `fiber.signal`, push NIL
- `SIG_YIELD` → store in `fiber.signal`, return yield
- `SIG_RESUME` → dispatch to fiber handler
- `SIG_PROPAGATE` → propagate child fiber's signal, preserve child chain
- `SIG_CANCEL` → inject error into target fiber
- `SIG_QUERY` → dispatch to `dispatch_query()`, push result to stack. Operations: `arena/allocs` (re-entrant, handled before dispatch), `arena/stats`, `arena/scope-stats`, `arena/fiber-stats`, `call-count`, `doc`, `global?`, `fiber/self`, `list-primitives`, `primitive-meta`

All SIG_RESUME primitives (including coroutine wrappers) return
`(SIG_RESUME, fiber_value)`. The VM uses `FiberHandle::take()`/`put()` to swap
the child fiber into `vm.fiber`, executes the child, then swaps back.

On resume, the VM wires up the parent/child chain (Janet semantics):
- `parent.child = child_handle` before executing child
- On signal caught (SIG_OK or mask match): clear `parent.child = None`
- On signal NOT caught (propagates): leave `parent.child` set (trace chain)

## Dependents

- `primitives/` - NativeFn primitives; SIG_RESUME signals trigger VM-side execution
- `repl.rs` - runs compiled code
- `main.rs` - file execution

## Invariants

1. **Stack underflow is a VM bug.** Every pop must have a preceding push.
   If you see "Stack underflow," the bytecode or emitter is broken. Handlers
   panic on stack underflow.

2. **Closure environments are immutable Rc<Vec>.** The vec is created at
   closure call time; mutations go through cells, not env modification.

3. **`LocalLBox` auto-unwraps on `LoadUpvalue`.** `LBox` (user's `box`) does
   NOT auto-unwrap. This distinction matters.

4. **Tail calls don't grow call_depth.** `TailCall` stores pending call info
   and returns; the outer loop executes it. Stack overflow = tail call bug.

5. **Yield uses `SuspendedFrame` chains.** On yield, a `SuspendedFrame`
   captures bytecode (`Rc`), constants (`Rc`), env (`Rc`), IP, and operand
   stack. When yield propagates through Call instructions, each caller's frame
   is appended to `fiber.suspended`. `resume_suspended` replays frames from
   innermost (index 0) to outermost (last index).

6. **VM bugs panic, user errors set `fiber.signal`.** Instruction handlers
   return `()` (not `Result`). VM bugs (stack underflow, bad bytecode) panic
   immediately. User errors (type mismatch, division by zero) set
   `fiber.signal` to `(SIG_ERROR, error_val(kind, msg))`, push `Value::NIL`
   to keep the stack consistent, and return normally. The dispatch loop checks
   `fiber.signal` for `SIG_ERROR` after each instruction and returns
   immediately. See `set_error()` in `call.rs` and `fiber.rs` for the helper.

### Key Fiber fields (on `vm.fiber`)

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `stack` | `SmallVec<[Value; 256]>` | Operand stack |
| `call_stack` | `Vec<CallFrame>` | For stack traces |
| `call_depth` | `usize` | Stack overflow detection |

| `child_value` | `Option<Value>` | Cached NaN-boxed Value for child (identity-preserving) |

## Re-entrancy

`execute_bytecode_saving_stack` makes the VM re-entrant. It saves the caller's
operand stack and active allocator pointer, runs inner bytecode from IP 0, then
restores both on return. The inner execution sees an empty stack and runs on the
same fiber (same heap, globals, parameter frames).

### Callers

| Caller | File | Context |
|--------|------|---------|
| `eval` primitive | `eval.rs` | Compiles and runs Elle source from within running code |
| Non-yielding `fiber/resume` | `call.rs` | Runs a child fiber inline on the current thread |
| `arena/allocs` SIG_QUERY handler | `signal.rs` | Runs a thunk to measure its allocations |
| JIT trampolines | `call.rs` | Re-enters interpreter for uncompiled hot paths |
| Coroutine resume | `call.rs` | Resumes a suspended coroutine |

### Yield hazard

If the inner closure yields (`SIG_YIELD`), the saved outer stack is restored but
the fiber is suspended mid-inner-execution. Callers that invoke user-provided
closures (`eval`, `arena/allocs`) do not handle yield — they propagate the signal
upward. Closures passed to these must be non-yielding (inert signal). This is not
currently enforced at the call site.

See `execute.rs` module doc for the full rules on what is preserved, what is
overwritten, and how to add new callers.

## Suspension mechanism

When a fiber suspends (via yield instruction or `emit`):

1. **Yield instruction** (`handle_yield`): captures innermost frame as a
   `SuspendedFrame` with bytecode (Rc clone), constants (Rc clone), env
   (Rc clone), IP (after yield), and operand stack. Stored in `fiber.suspended`.
2. **Call handler** (if yield propagates through a call): appends caller's
   frame to `fiber.suspended` vec.
3. **Signal suspension** (`emit`): single `SuspendedFrame` with empty
   stack, stored in `fiber.suspended` by the resume handler.
4. **Frame ordering**: innermost (yielder/signaler) at index 0, outermost
   (caller) at last index.
5. **Resume** (`resume_suspended`): iterates frames forward, calling
   `execute_bytecode_from_ip` for each. Handles re-yields and errors.

Key methods:
- `execute_bytecode_from_ip`: Executes from a given IP with Rc bytecode/constants
- `execute_bytecode_saving_stack`: Saves/restores caller's stack and active_allocator, handles tail calls
- `resume_suspended`: Replays `Vec<SuspendedFrame>`, handles re-yields and errors
- `with_child_fiber`: Shared swap protocol for fiber resume/cancel. Also
  manages per-fiber heap routing: saves the current thread-local heap pointer,
  installs the child fiber's `FiberHeap`, executes, then restores the saved
  pointer on swap-back. Root fibers have no heap installed (allocate to the
  global `HEAP_ARENA`); only child fibers get per-fiber heap routing.
  For yielding fibers (signal includes `SIG_YIELD`), also provisions a shared allocator
  via a three-way branch (step 3b): (a) parent has shared_alloc → propagate
  down, (b) root parent → child creates its own, (c) non-root parent →
  create on parent's heap. Cleared on swap-back (step 7a).

## Allocation region instructions

`RegionEnter` and `RegionExit` push/pop scope marks on the current FiberHeap
via `region_enter()`/`region_exit()`. No-op for the root fiber (no FiberHeap
installed). The lowerer gates emission on escape analysis — currently maximally
conservative, so no region instructions are emitted in normal code.

## Active allocator pointer

`FiberHeap` has an `active_allocator: *const bumpalo::Bump` pointer that currently
always points to the fiber's root bump. Supports future scope-level redirection.

**Initialization:** `init_active_allocator()` is called in `with_child_fiber` after
the child's heap is installed as thread-local (pointer stability requires the heap
to be in its final Box location).

**Save/restore on Call/Return:** `execute_bytecode_saving_stack` saves the active
allocator pointer before execution and restores it after, so callee scope changes
don't leak into the caller's context.

**Save/restore on Yield/Resume:** `SuspendedFrame` carries `active_allocator` so the
pointer can be restored when a fiber resumes. All construction sites write the current
value via `save_active_allocator()`.

**Fiber swap:** `with_child_fiber` handles heap swapping. Each fiber's `active_allocator`
lives on its own `FiberHeap`, so fiber transitions naturally switch allocator context.

**Root fiber:** Has no FiberHeap installed. `save_active_allocator()` returns null,
`restore_active_allocator()` is a no-op.

## Fiber heap routing

Child fibers each own a `Box<FiberHeap>` (on the `Fiber` struct). When the
VM swaps to a child fiber via `with_child_fiber`, it installs the child's
heap as the thread-local allocation target. All `Value::cons()`, `Value::closure()`,
etc. calls during child execution route to the child's `FiberHeap` instead of
the global `HEAP_ARENA`. On swap-back, the parent's heap (or null for root)
is restored.

`FiberHeap` uses bumpalo for bump allocation. Destructor tracking ensures
`HeapObject` variants with inner heap allocations (`Vec`, `Rc`, `BTreeMap`,
`Box<str>`) have their `Drop` impls called on `release()` and `clear()`.
The bump itself only fully resets on `clear()` (fiber death); partial
`release()` runs destructors but does not reclaim bump memory (bumpalo has
no partial reset).

The root fiber does NOT install a heap. This is intentional: `execute_bytecode`
returns `Value`s that outlive the VM. If the root fiber's allocations went to
a `FiberHeap` owned by the VM, those Values would dangle after `VM::drop()`.
Root fiber allocations go to `HEAP_ARENA` (thread-local, outlives any VM).

`reset_fiber()` in `core.rs` extracts, clears, and reuses the heap `Box` to
maintain pointer stability (the thread-local stores a raw pointer to the heap).

## Shared allocator provisioning

When `with_child_fiber` swaps in a yielding child fiber, step 3b provisions
a `SharedAllocator` for zero-copy value exchange. The child's `FiberHeap`
receives a raw `*mut SharedAllocator` pointer — all allocations during child
execution route to this shared allocator instead of the child's private bump.

**Three-way branch** (after swap, `self.fiber` = child, `child_fiber` = parent):

1. **Parent has shared_alloc** (case a): Parent already received a shared_alloc
   from its own parent (A→B→C chain). Propagate the same pointer down.
2. **Root parent** (case b, `saved_heap.is_null()`): Root fiber has no FiberHeap.
   Child creates the shared allocator on its own FiberHeap's `owned_shared`.
3. **Non-root parent, no shared_alloc** (case c): Create a new shared allocator
   on the parent's FiberHeap's `owned_shared`.

**Signal gate (M1)**: Fibers whose closure has signal bits `SIG_YIELD` or `SIG_IO`
(checked via `may_yield() || may_io()`) get shared allocators. I/O fibers yield
`SIG_IO` requests that the parent (scheduler) must read, requiring a shared
allocator for value exchange. Non-yielding, non-I/O fibers skip step 3b entirely.

**Per-resume creation (M2 tech debt)**: Each resume of a yielding child creates
a new shared allocator because `shared_alloc` was nulled on the previous
swap-back. Old shared allocators accumulate in `owned_shared` until the owner's
`FiberHeap::clear()`. Optimization (reuse across resumes) is deferred.

**Cleanup (step 7a)**: Before swap-back, `self.fiber.heap.clear_shared_alloc()`
nulls the child's `shared_alloc` pointer. The shared allocator data remains
alive in the owner's `owned_shared` Vec.

## Parameter resolution

When a parameter is called (invoked as a function with no arguments), the VM
searches the parameter frame stack from top (most recent `parameterize`) to
bottom. If a binding is found, its value is returned. Otherwise, the parameter's
default value is returned.

**Frame structure**: `param_frames: Vec<Vec<(Value, Value)>>` is a stack of frames.
Each frame is a vector of (parameter, value) pairs. `PushParamFrame` pushes a new
frame; `PopParamFrame` pops the current frame. When a parameter is called, the VM
iterates from the top frame downward, searching for a matching parameter.

**Inheritance**: Child fibers inherit parent parameter frames. When a child fiber
is created, it copies the parent's `param_frames` stack. This allows child code
to see parent-established parameter bindings.

## Truthiness

The VM evaluates truthiness via `Value::is_truthy()`:
- `Value::NIL` → falsy
- `Value::FALSE` → falsy  
- Everything else (including `Value::EMPTY_LIST`, `Value::int(0)`) → truthy

The `Instruction::Nil` pushes `Value::NIL` (falsy).
The `Instruction::EmptyList` pushes `Value::EMPTY_LIST` (truthy).
